### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```<div class="container cntr">
      <div class="image">
        <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR Code">
      </div>
      <div class="mytext">
        <h2>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>

        <p class: second>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
      </div>
  </div>

```

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  background-color: white;
  margin: auto;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 15px;
  border-radius: 15px;
  max-width: 350px;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

Flex and content handling.

### Useful resources
